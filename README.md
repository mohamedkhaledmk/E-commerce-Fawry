# Fawry E-Commerce System ‚Äì Java Internship Challenge

## ‚úÖ Overview

This project is a fully functional Java-based e-commerce system designed as part of the **Fawry Rise Internship Challenge**.

It supports:
- Product modeling (name, price, quantity, expiry, shipping).
- Customer balance and purchase validation.
- Cart management and order checkout.
- Shipping service simulation.
- Validation for edge cases and exceptions.

üß™ **Note**:  
A file named `Test.java` was used during the early development stages to manually test individual features (e.g., product creation, expiry check, and shipping behavior).  
As the system matured, formal test cases were created (`Test1.java`, `Test2.java`, etc.).  
Older versions of the project can be viewed through my **Git commit history**.

| `ShippableProduct`          | Products that require shipping                   |
| `ExpirableShippableProduct` | Products that can expire and require shipping    |
| `Cart`                      | Adds products with quantity, validates stock     |
| `Customer`                  | Stores name and balance, allows deduction        |
| `CheckoutService`           | Handles full checkout: subtotal, shipping, etc.  |
| `ShippingService`           | Simulates packaging and total weight             |
| `ECommerceFawry`            | Main runner for a full scenario simulation       |
| `Test`                      | Early-phase development sandbox (optional)       |

### üìÅ Test Files (default package)

| File              | Purpose                                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Test1.java`      | Tests expired product validation                    |
| `Test2.java`      | Tests adding product with quantity exceeding stock  |
| `Test3.java`      | Tests empty cart checkout                           |
| `Test4.java`      | Tests insufficient balance handling                 |
| `TestCustomer.java` | Tests customer creation and balance deduction     |

Each file is self-contained and prints output indicating whether validation is working as expected.

## üß™ How to Run Tests

Run each test individually:

1. In NetBeans, right-click the file (e.g., `Test1.java`)
2. Choose **Run File** or press `Shift + F6`

Expected output:

‚úÖ Test1 Passed: Cannot add expired product: Milk
‚úÖ Test2 Passed: Requested quantity exceeds available stock for: TV
‚úÖ Test3 Passed: Cannot checkout with an empty cart.
‚úÖ Test4 Passed: Customer has insufficient balance.
‚úÖ Test5.1 Passed: Created customer with balance 500.0
‚úÖ Test5.4 Passed: Insufficient balance.

- Run `TestCustomer.java` to verify customer logic.
